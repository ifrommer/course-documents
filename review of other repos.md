Trying to get a feel for git repos, am reviewing some of the ones I starred:

### datascience-course
- readme.md
- folders for each hw
 - folders have .md, .png (which shows up in the .md, a la html), .csv (these show up nicely formatted)
 - also
  - .ipynb (Jup nb's, shown statically - I did this in my PyCon one)
- Some of the .ipynb's have places for student to insert their code and output.
This is kind of like what we did in MTCA.
  
 ### My PyCon repo
 Has .md, .ipynb, .jpg, .png
 
 ### Jake VdP's data sci book
 Can launch his jup nb's on google colab and run them.
